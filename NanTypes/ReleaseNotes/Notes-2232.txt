Build #2232 -- Version 0.6.0.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Parser Bug With Double Free With Index Coalescing
* Fix Parser Bug With "A FR"

Directory branches/bsmith/NanTypes:

PARSELINE.C:
  In <plRedNAM_ISPA>, if the call to <CoalesceIdx_EM> fails, zap the curried index
    as it has already been freed by <CoalesceIdx_EM>.
  In <PARSELINE_REDUCE:>, detect "A FR" and fail softly.  This should be made to work.
