Build #1791 -- Version 0.5.5.xx
--------------------------------

* Implement Matrix Operator
* Obtain Schur Vectors and QR Matrices From Variant Operator On Domino

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

COMPRO.H:
  Include prototype file in header.

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Include new symbol in Keyboard Customize preferences.
  Use local function <MySetFocus> instead of <SetFocus> API so we can check the return code more easily.
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.

EXECFNS.C:
  Handle QuadJot as a Monadic Operator.

EXECMFN.C:
EXECMFN.H:
  Convert calls to static messages to Unicode.
  Include Magic Operator for Matrix Operator in Magic Function/Operator tables.

INITDATA.C:
  Change documentation for QuadJot from Alt-D to Alt-F.
  Define entry in <InitPrimProtoFns> for QuadJot.
  Define entry in <InitPrimFlags> for QuadJot.

KEYBOARDS_BI.H:
  Note that Alt-F is no longer an available keystroke.
  Define QuadJot for the built-in for both Alt- and Ctrl- keyboard tables .

MAKEFILE.INC:
MAKEFILE.SRC:
  Alphabetize the file names.
  Include the file name for QuadJot.
  Note that <defines.h> depends upon <WineHQ\WineCom.h>.

MF_QUADJOT.H:
  Define Magic Operator to handle Matrix Operator.

MF_VARIANT.H:
  Document a Magic Function.

NARS2000.VCXPROJ:
NARS2000.VCXPROJ.FILTERS:
  Document new source file <po_quadjot.c>.

PF_DOMINO.C:
  Consolidate code into subroutines so they may be called multiple times.
  Attempt to demote HCxF matrices to HC1F so we can use GSL Real code instead of GSL Complex.
  Attempt to demote HC2F matrix using GSL Complex instead of Gauss-Jordan on RATs.
  If Gauss-Jordan on HC4F/HC8F fails, attempt to demote to HC2F so we can use GSL Complex.

PO_QUADJOT.C:
PO_QUADJOT.H:
  Implement Matrix Operator.

PO_VARIANT.C:
  Extend Variant operator on QuadJot operator to be sensitive to []DQ.
  Extend Variant operator on Domino function to return Schur vectors and QR matrices.
  If the left operand is the Domino function, allow the right operand to be a function.
  If the left operand is the Domino function and the right operand is a function, call a Magic Operator to execute it.
  If the right arg is not a simple integer or float, see if it can be demoted to that type.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Define function to returns attributes of either a SYMENTRY or HGLOBAL.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  Fix typo in comment.

REBAR.C:
  Document the QuadJot operator on the Language Bar.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Include QuadJot as a monadic operator in various tables.

TYPEMOTE.C:
  Improve comments.
  Define routines to demote data as appropriate.

UNICODE.H:
  Define Unicode value for QuadJot symbol.
  Improve comments.
