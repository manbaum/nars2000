-------------------------------

* Fix Bug In )LOAD If A UDFO Is Deleted During Load
* Fix Bug In )LOAD If A Permanent Variable Is Loaded

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

SC_LOAD.C:
  Prepare for Java-defined functions by splitting cases based upon the function signature.
  In <ParseSavedWsFcn_EM>, test for a function being deleted during the call to <LoadWorkspaceGlobal_EM>.
  Fix bug in <LoadWorkspaceGlobal_EM> when loading a variable whose value is a permanent global (e.g., {zilde}).
    This variable mistakenly is not appended to the SYMENTRY link chain and as a result the global entry of ":nnn"
    is not freed from the symbol table.  A subsequent )COPY of a name which uses the same global entry of ":nnn"
    then is not handled correctly.
  Move Monitor Information code to a separate function in preparation for Java-defined functions which also need that code.
