Version 0.0.2.3 consists of the following Builds:


Build #509-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Generate the correct identity element for catenate reduction empty

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  Define additional arg to <CopyGlbMemory> to use <MyGlobalAlloc> so it can
    be used in <CopyArray_EM>.

EXECFNS.C:
  Define new function <ExecFcnStrLine_EM_YY> to allow passing of starting
    line # type.

GETFNS.C:
  In <GetGlbPtrs_LOCK>, handle <TKT_FCNARRAY> case.
  In <GetPrototypeFcnPtr>, split out FCNARRAY_HEADERs from DFN_HEADERs.

PF_COMMA.C:
  Improve comments.
  Goto ERROR_EXIT instead of returning directly so as to maintain
    a common exit point.
  Include additional assertion about the incoming function.

PO_DIERESIS.C:
  Get the operand axis token along with the operator axis token and
    use them in the appropriate places.

PO_DITILDE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Fix errors in comments.

PO_SLASH.C:
  Generate the correct identity elenment for catenate reduction empty.
  Call user-defined fucntion/operator at []IDENTITY if reducing empty.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Define additional arg to <CopyGlbMemory> to use <MyGlobalAlloc> so it can
    be used in <CopyArray_EM>.
  In <CopyArray_EM>, split out arrays of variables from arrays of functions.
  Define new routine to determine if a token is a user-defined function/operator.


Build #508-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Split Out Syntax Coloring for Primitives into Functions, Monadic, and Dyadic Operators.

Directory trunk:

EXTERNS.H:
  Define names for new Syntax Coloring categories.

INIFILE.C:
  Define .ini file key names for additional Syntax Color categories.

MAIN.RC:
  Define new size of dialog box to accommodate new Syntax Color categories.
  Define entries for new Syntax Color categories.

RESOURCE.H:
  Define equates in the Customize dialog for new Syntax Color categories.

SYNTAXCOLORS.H:
  Define default colors for new Syntax Color categories.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Use new Syntax Color category names as appropriate.


Build #507-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  When a named function array is used in a statement and an error
  is signalled because of something in that named function array (e.g. AXIS ERROR),
  rebase the character indices for all tokens in the function array to that of the
  named function so as to have the caret point to the named function with the error.

Directory trunk:

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Pass additional parameter to <MakeNameFcnOpr_YY> to indicate hwether or not
    we should rebase the function tokens if the named function is a function
    array.
  In <pl_yylex/case TKT_OP1IMMED:>, remove unnecessary code.

STRAND.C:
  Pass additional parameter to <MakeNameFcnOpr_YY> to indicate hwether or not
    we should rebase the function tokens if the named function is a function
    array.

YYFNS.C:
  In <YYCountFcnStr>, count the individual tokens in a function array.
  In <YYCopyFcn>, copy the individual tokens in a function array and
    save them at the top level in the result rather than just point to the
    function array global memory handle.
  In <IncrFcnMem>, handle immediate axis values.


Build #506-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  An uninitialized variable  in grade up/down causes a system crash
    if it needs to signal an error.

Directory trunk:

PF_DELTASTILE.C:
  Fix Bug:  A variable is uninitialized such that if grade up/down signals
    an error, the system crashes.


Build #505-- Version 0.0.2.3
----------------------------

* Avoid Deadlock of Sending Message to Suspended Thread

Directory trunk:

IMMEXEC.C:
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, don't call <ForceSendCursorMsg> if we're
    not waiting until finished as the message might be sent to another
    thread.

VERSION.RC:
  Increment version #.
