Build #1771 -- Version 0.5.5.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Saving A Maximized Program

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

DEFINES.H:
  Define a new user local Window message.

MAIN.C:
  Rename <nMinState> to <nWinState> to better reflect its meaning.
  In <MFWndProc> define and save the initial alue of <MFState> from
    the .ini fileto test later on as the latter value can change
    before we need the original value.
  If the original value of <MFState> says to maximize the initial
    window, do so after the <WM_CREATE> message.
