Build #1930 -- Version 0.5.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bugs In []CR When Passed A Variable Or System Function

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

MACROS.H:
  Define macros to identify IMMTYPE_xxx functions and operators.

QF_CR.C:
  In <SysFnCR_Common_EM_YY>, return empty result if an immediate input is not a function/operator.
  In <SysFnCR_Common_EM_YY>, call separate function to copy the FCN/OPR name of the immediate input to the result.
  Define new function <CopyFcnName> to copy the name of a internal system function to the result.

SYSVARS.C:
  Define a variable containing the number of rows in <aSystemNames> so it can be used in other files.
  Fix typo in comment.
  In <DeleSysVars>, check for deleted vars before doing it again.
  In <DeleMfoSysVars>, zap the item just deleted so we don't try to delete it again.
