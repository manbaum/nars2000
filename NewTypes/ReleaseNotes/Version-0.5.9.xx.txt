SAVEFCN.C:
SESSMAN.C:
  Pass the EPB value to <AllocHshTab> as they differ from GLB to others.
  Pass Boolean value to <AllocHshTab> & <AllocSymtab> to indicate whether or not to link the MEMVIRT_STR into a chain.

EXTERNS.H:
  Initialize the Boolean value that indicates whether the CSOs have been initialized.
  Define new enum for the GLB SymTab in MEMVIRTENUM.

  In <SymtabHTSAppendXXXX> ...
  Replace references to "->steXXX", for XXX in "One", "Blank", "NaN", etc. with "htsGLB.steXXX".
  Pass the EPB value to <AllocHshTab> as they differ from GLB to others.
