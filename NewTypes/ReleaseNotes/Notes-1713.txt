Build #1713 -- Version 0.5.1.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Negating A Rational Hypercomplex Zero When Negative 0 Allowed

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PF_BAR.C:
  Define matching <NegHC[124]R_RE> functions to handle exceptions that need to be raised at a higher degree of an exception such as HC2V to HC4V.

PF_TIMES.C:
  In <MulHC[248]R_RE>, call <NegHC[124]R_RE1> instead of <NegHC[124]_RE> so as to handle upgrading the exception from 2V to 4V to 8V.
