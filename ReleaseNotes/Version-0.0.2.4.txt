    namespace.
  In <InitSystemNames>, call <SymTabAppendAllSysNames>.
  In <InitSystemVars>, split out the assignment of system vars into

SYSVARS.H:
  Move <SYS_VARS> enum to <sysvars.h>.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Rename <bInUse> to <gbInUse> to reflect its global state.
  Use separate FSA actions to handle single and double quotes

    double quote).
  Define new FSA row and column for system namespaces.
  Rename <lpStart>/<lpNext>/<lpLastEOS> to
    <lptkStart>/<lptkNext>/<lptkLastEOS> to reflect that

  When setting a syntax color, also set the corresponding name
    type and column index.

TOKENIZE.H:
  Define new FSA row and column for system namespaces.
  Rename <lpStart>/<lpNext>/<lpLastEOS> to
    <lptkStart>/<lptkNext>/<lptkLastEOS> to reflect that
