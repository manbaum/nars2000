* Allow {del} As Argument []AT, []CR, []STOP, []TRACE, []VR

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

MACROS.H:
  Include <UTF16_DEL> in <IsDirectName> macro.

PARSELINE.C:
PRIMFNS.C:
  Pass additional parameter to <SrchSISForDfn> to indicate whether or not to skip over Magic Functions.

PL_PROC.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  Pass additional parameter to <SrchSISForDfn> to indicate whether or not to skip over Magic Functions.

QF_AT.C:
  In <AttributeCommon>, if the SYMENTRY is {del}, substitute the actual LPSYMENTRY of the suspended/pendent function.

QF_CR.C:
QF_STRACE.C:
  Allow {del} as argument to []AT, []CR, []STOP, []TRACE, []VR

QF_NC.C:
  Allow {del} as argument to []AT, []CR, []STOP, []TRACE, []VR
  Define <IsSymDel> to detect if a SYMENTRY is the character scalar <UTF16_DEL>.
  Define <GetSymDel> to return the actual LPSYMENTRY of the suspended/pendent function.
  In <CalcNameClass>, check for <UTF16_DEL> first and return name class <UsrFcn>.
