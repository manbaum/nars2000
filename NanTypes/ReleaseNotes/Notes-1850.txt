* Fix Bug In TabCtrl When )LOAD Fails With Error In Workspace File

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

TABCTRL.C:
  In <CreateNewTabInThread>, if a )LOAD fails due to an error in the workspace file and <gOverTabIndex> has not been set as yet, set it to the index of the current tab before deleting the tab that failed.
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  In <LclTabCtrlWndProc/TCMDELETEITEM>, if there are still tabs, use <PostThreadMessageW> on the outgoing tan thread id.  Otherwise, use <PostQuitMessage> to terminate the last TabCtrl thread.
