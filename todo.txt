QUESTIONS
---------
* In assignment, can a var overwrite a fn (prim or user), and vice versa
  or must the original object be erased first?  Are there any limitations?
* In function assignment,

  f{is}+/
  g{is}f[1]

  what should <g> reference?  By value or by reference?
  what happens to <g> if we change <f>?
* Should we allow f {is} {jot}fn or {jot}{dot} ?? (right operator)
* Should we allow f {is} {jot}fn               ?? (left operator)
* How should an empty vector display?
  On APL+WIN systems 3.6 + 5.x, '' displays by skipping one blank line
  but 0{rho}{enclose}'' displays without skipping a blank line.
* If a defined function indicates in its header that a result is to be
  returned, should we allow it to exit if that var has not been set?

  What about multiple results such as {del}(Z1 Z2 ...) {is} foo R,
  where Z1 is set, but not Z2?

  What if no Zn is set -- should we allow the function to exit
  with no result as in {del}Z{is}FOO R when Z is unset??
* In an error message ([]DM) which symbol is used for the caret:
  UTF16_CIRCUMFLEX or UTF16_UPCARET??
* With a{is}0{rho}{enclose}0 0
  should either a[]{is}0{rho}{enclose}0 0 0
             or a[;]{is}0{rho}{enclose}0 0 0
  transfer the prototype to the named var?
* Why limit []PP on the high side?
* Should LEFT xxx ERROR caret point to left arg, etc.?
* What to do with format-by-specification on simple char right arg
  (e.g. 5 0{thorn}'abc')?
* In format-by-specification, does automatic width apply across planes
  or is it different within each plane?
* Is there any reason to limit []AV to 256 elements?
* What should be the result of {del} z {is} z foo z ?
* How does Dyalog decide whether or not the result from a primitive function is shy?
* Should {leftrarrow} be interpreted as a (dyadic) function as Dyalog does, e.g. there
  is an example in their manual of {quad}{jot}{leftarrow}{jot}{quad}VR{each}R ?
* Also, what category does {quad} belong to in the above line?
* What is the shape of {domino}scalar?  APL+WIN says ,1 and APL2 says {zilde}
  and the Extended APL Standard's Evaluation Sequence has a bug which
  causes it to signal a LENGTH ERROR.
* What letters of Unicode should be allowed in var/fcn names?
* Should []TS be a system variable?
* How to produce )OUT for a variable with non-ASCII chars in its name?
* Should we store complex #s as floats only or floats and ints?
*

ATF File Questions
------------------
* How to represent the name of a var with non-ASCII chars?
* How to represent a function line with non-APL2 symbols?


File Extensions
---------------

All files specific to NARS will end in the extension ".nars".  There will be a
secondary extension to the left of the global extension such as .ws.nars for
workspaces, (e.g. porsche.ws.nars).

Workspaces              .ws.nars
File Systems            .file.nars
Plugins                 .plugin.nars
Initialization File     .ini


Edge Conditions
---------------
* 2 3{take}[1 2] 45 <==> 2 3{take}[1 2] 1 1{rho}45
* 2 3{drop}[1 2] 45 <==> 2 3{drop}[1 2] 1 1{rho}45
*


Anomalous Results
-----------------
* =/'a' and =\'a' both return 'a' which isn't in the range
  of "=" -- that seems odd.
* Similarly, =\3 0{rho}'' returns its argument with a prototype
  which isn't in the range of the derived function.
* ...


ToDo
----
* Review IBM APL2 Deviations & Restrictions
* Optimize CopyArray_EM by copying the top level only
*
