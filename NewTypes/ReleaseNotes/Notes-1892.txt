Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

AXISFNS.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  Rename <CheckAxisGlb> to <CheckAxisGlb_EM> as it sets an Error Message.
  Move code from <CheckAxis_EM> to its own subroutine for better maintenance.
  In <CheckAxis_EM>, handle <TKT_LSTMULT> although <MakeAxis_EM> catches it first.

COMMON.C:
  Ensure <AllocateGlobalArray> returns a value with the Pointer Type Bits set.

CS_PROC.C:
PF_CSTILE.C:
PO_DOT.C:
  Rename <CopyToken_EM> to <CopyToken> as it does not set an Error Message.

DATATYPE.H:
  Include <RefCnt> entry in the <LSTARRAY_HEADER> struc so we can make copies.

DISPDBG.C:
  In <_ValidObj> test for valid ptr when in DEBUG mode.

EXECDFN.C:
  In <InitVarSTEs>, handle <TKT_LSTMULT> tokens as an empty Axis Array.

FREE.C:
  In <FreeResultGlobalLst>, handle list arrays with RefCnt.
  In <FreeResultGlobalFcn>, handle <TKT_LSTMULT> as a separate token.

GETFNS.C:
  In <GetGlbMem_LOCK>, handle <TKT_LSTARRAY> the same as <TKT_LSTMULT>.

MF_DOT.H:
  Fix bug in the Magic Operator that handles APL2's Inner Product.

MF_SQUAD.H:
  Fix bug in Magic Function for Dyadic Squad not catching a LENGTH/AXIS ERROR.

PARSELINE.C:
  Rename <MakeAxis_YY> to <MakeAxis_EM_YY> as it now sets an Error Message.
  Check for errors from <MakeAxis_EM>.
  Change calls to <MakeAxis_EM_YY> to reflect the above change.

PF_COMMA.C:
PF_CSLOPE.C:
PF_DARROW.C:
PF_RSHOE.C:
PF_SLASH.C:
PF_SLOPE.C:
PF_SQUAD.C:
PF_UARROW.C:
PO_SLOPE.C:
  Delete test for right arg as a list as <Parseline> doesn't allow it.
  Improve comments.

PO_SLASH.C:
QF_DC.C:
  Improve comments.

PF_LSHOE.C:
  Fix bug in <LftShoeGlbCom_EM> when enclosing an empty which returns a non-empty.
  Improve comments.

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <AttrsOfToken>, handle <TKT_LSTARRAY> the same as <TKT_LSTMULT>.
  In <IsTknTypeAxis>, handle <TKT_LSTMULT> the same as <TKT_AXISARRAY>.

REFCNT.C:
  In <ChangeRefCntDir_PTB>, handle <LSTARRAY_HEADER>s.

STARTADDR.H:
  Rename <MakeAxis_YY> to <MakeAxis_EM_YY> as it now sets an Error Message.
  Rename <CopyToken_EM> to <CopyToken> as it does not set an Error Message.

STRAND.C:
  Rename <CopyToken_EM> to <CopyToken> as it does not set an Error Message.
  Fix bug in various functions using the wrong character index.
  Rename <MakeAxis_YY> to <MakeAxis_EM_YY> as it now sets an Error Message.
  In <MakeAxis_EM_YY>, handle <TKT_LSTMULT> as an AXIS ERROR.
  In <MakeList_EM_YY>, set the list array RefCnt.
  Rename <CopyToken_EM> to <CopyToken> as it does not set an Error Message.
  In <CopyToken>, increment the RefCnt for list arrays.
