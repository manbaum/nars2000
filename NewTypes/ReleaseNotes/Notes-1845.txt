Build #1845 -- Version 0.5.5.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Timing Problem When Closing A Tab

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PERTAB.H:
  Define a bit flag to indicate whether or not )RESET is in progress via <CreateResetThread>.

TABCTRL.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  In <LclTabCtrlWndProc/TCM_DELETEITEM>, if there are any outstanding SIS layers, execute )RESET
    and repeat the message until it finishes.
  In <FreeGlobalStorage>, we no longer need to test for suspensions as that's
    handled by the <TCM_DELETEITEM> message.
