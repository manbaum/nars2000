* Fix Bug When Hash Or Symbol Tables Are Low

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXCEPT.C:
  Compare against correct equate instead of just 0.

EXECMFN.C:
  When allocating Hash & Symbol Tables, indicate whether or not the owner is an AFO or MFO.
  Use equates for Hash & Symbol Table allocation sizes instead of constants.
  Use variable name for Hash & Symbol Table maximum NELM instead of constant so it can be overridden on the command line.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define external vars for command line values.

MAIN.C:
  Use different equate for <iHshTabIncrFree> value.
  In <TestCmdLine>, allow a colon as well as an equal sign to separate the keyword and it's matching value.
  In <ParseCommandLine>, test for additional keywords.

SAVEFCN.C:
  When allocating Hash & Symbol Tables, indicate whether or not the owner is an AFO or MFO.
  Use variable name for Hash & Symbol Table maximum NELM instead of constant so it can be overridden on the command line.

SC_SYMB.C:
  Change type from <int> to <size_t> and rename from <i...> to <u...> to reflect the unsigned nature.

SESSMAN.C:
  When allocating Hash & Symbol Tables, indicate whether or not the owner is an AFO or MFO.

SYMTAB.C:

  In <HshTabSplitNextEntry_EM>, read from last byte we might split into so as to trigger the Page Fault early before we have moved any Hash Table Entries because we can't move them back if we fail.
  In <FindNextFreeUsingHash_SPLIT_EM> and <FindNextFreeUsingHTE_EM>, trap errors in called functions so as to pass the error on to our caller,
    and use 64-bit arithmetic on the offsets in case the 32-bit offset might overflow.

SYMTAB.H:
  Define equates for AFO and MFO Hash & Symbol Tables.
  Define additional fields in <HSHTABSTR>.

VER.C:
  Use proper equates for Hash & Symbol Table multipliers.

  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, after executing the stmt, if the <exitType> is <STOP>, don't act on errors.


Build #1729 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Reduction Of An Empty Character Array

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PO_SLASH.C:

--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Inner Product With Storage Types

Build #1726 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Inner Product Using Wrong Storage Type

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PO_DOT.C:
  In <PrimOpDydDotCommon_EM_YY>, when doing the reduction part (i.e., calling <PrimFnDydSiScSiScSub_EM>),
    we pass the wrong storage type for the reduction value so far.  This bug affects Inner Products whose
    Comparison storage type is lower then the Reduction storage type, such as +.=.

--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In The Magic Function For []VR Not Using A Local HSHTABSTR

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECMFN.C:
  Make explicit tests of ptr against "NE NULL".
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  In <Init1MagicFunction>, check for incoming <INIT_MFO> struc and handle accordingly.
  In <InitMagicFunctions>, initialize a local struc <INIT_MFO> to pass additional args to <Init1MagicFunction>.

PERTAB.H:
  Allocate room for a local HSHTABSTR for the []VR magic function.

QF_VR.C:
  In <SysFnMonVR_EM_YY>, pass a ptr to the local HSHTABSTR for the magic function.
