* Implement System Labels In AFOs

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECDFN.C:
  Save Token # along with Line # for a System Label.
  Pass starting token # to <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>.
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>, delete code to disallow falling into a SysLbl in an AFO.
  Document the Line # and Token # values.

EXECMFN.C:
IMMEXEC.C:
PF_UTACKJOT.C:
  Document the Line # and Token # values.

FH_PARSE.H:
  Delete unneeded <bSysLbl> flag in <FCNLINE> struc.
  Define <SYSLBLENTRY> struc to hold both the Line and Token #s for a SysLbl.

PARSELINE.C:
  Document the Line # and Token # values.
  Handle initial non-zero Token #.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Define function to determine whether or not a Token is that of a System Label.

SAVEFCN.C:
  In <GetLabelNums>, look for SysLbls in any stmt in an AFO line.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <fnClnDone>, check for a SysLbl in AFOs and mark as such.
  Document the various stmts in terms of their tokens.

TOKENS.H:
  Define a flag in <TKFLAGS> to indicate that a stmt is a SysLbl.
