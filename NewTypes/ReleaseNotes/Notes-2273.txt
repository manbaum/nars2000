* Define FEATURE Bit To Distinguish -0 And 0

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

COMMON.C:
  Define new functions to compare FLT/VFP against +0.

CONVERT.C:
  In <flt_cmp_ct>, distinguish between -0 and 0 if requested.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define new bit in []FEATURE to distinguish between -0 and 0.

FPCHO_COM.C:
  In <fpXf_scale>, handle {inf} x 0 differently from NaN x 0.

FPCHO_COM.MAC:
  In macro <fpXf_mag_imag8> handle non-finite case.

HC_PROC.C:
PF_DOMINO.C:
  Rename <Myhcxr_clewar> and <Myhcxv_clear> to be more consistent.

MACROS.H:
  Define macreos to test for NEG0_NE0.

MPFNS.C:
  In <mpfr_get_ctsx> handle {inf}{ as FALSE in result rather than longjmp.

PF_DELTASTILE.C:
  In <mpfr_cmp_ct>, distinguish between -0 and 0 if requested.

PF_ROOT.C:
  In <SqrtHCxF_RE>, remove redundant code.
  In <SqrtHCxV_RE>, fix memory leak.

PF_STAR.C:
  In <ExpHC2F_RE> and <ExpHC2V_RE> handle missing case.

TYPEMOTE.C:
  In <TypeDemote>, distinguish between -0 and 0 if requested.
