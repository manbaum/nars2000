Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

ASSIGN.C:
  Handle new TKT_xxxDFN tokens.
  When assigning a Fcn Array into a name, calculate the token type from the source.
  Fix typos in comments.

DISPDBG.C:
  Define three new tokens for unnamed UDFOs (TKT_FCNDFN, TKT_OP1DFN, and TKT_OP2DFN).
  Re-order the existing tokens to group related objects.
  In <DisplayFcnGlb>, fix bug of displaying the right most function in a Train separately to the left of the start of the Train.
  In <DisplayFcnSub>, use <FillDfnName> to fill in the UDFO name so as to handle <:g> entries in a loaded workspace.
  Handle new TKT_xxxDFN tokens.

EXECDFN.C:
EXECFNS.C:
FREE.C:
GETFNS.C:
PRIMFNS.C:
STRAND.C:
  Handle new TKT_xxxDFN tokens.

EXTERNS.H:
MAIN.C:
  Allow <Tokenize_EM> to be re-entrant.

PARSELINE.C:
  Define reduction actions for new syntax of (MOPN MOPN) and related.
  In <ConvertHY2PFO>, handle more source tokens, and define a new argument for Fcn Array items.
  Improve some comments.
  Always set the token count in a PL_YYSTYPE.
  In <pl_yylexCOM>, consolidate blocks of similar code into a function.
  Handle new TKT_xxxDFN tokens.

PARSELINE.H:
  Define new syntax such as (MOPN MOPN) and related.
  Fix bug in syntax of nested Trains by making Trans and MOPs at the same level.

QF_AT.C:
  In <AttributeFixTime> separate Fcn Arrays from UDFOs solely as a DEBUG aid.

REFCNT.C:
  In <ChangeRefCntFcnArray>, remove <DbgStop> for nested Trains as that expression triggers this case.
  Handle new TKT_xxxDFN tokens.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Allow <Tokenize_EM> to be re-entrant.
  In <IsLocalname>, handle trailing comments on Line Continuations.
  Delete <DbgMsgW> stmts no longer needed.
  Delete stmts to get <lpMemPTD> that are no longer needed.
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  In <CheckConstantCopyLoad>, fill in Fcn Array case even though I'm not sure how it can occur.
  Handle new TKT_xxxDFN tokens.

TOKENS.H:
  Define three new tokens for unnamed UDFOs (TKT_FCNDFN, TKT_OP1DFN, and TKT_OP2DFN).
  Re-order the existing tokens to group related objects.
  Fix mistakes in comments.

TOKENSO.H:
  Number the entries in <tokenSo> for DEBUGging purposes.
  Define three new tokens for unnamed UDFOs (TKT_FCNDFN, TKT_OP1DFN, and TKT_OP2DFN).
  Re-order the existing tokens to group related objects.

TRANSLATE.C:
  Define new routine to translate an <SO_ENUM> type to a named token type.

YYFNS.C:
  In <YYAlloc>, initialize the token count in the result.
  In <YYCopyFcnTrn>, split cases based upon the token type.
