Build #1919 -- Version 0.5.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug Introduced In Previous Build

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PRIMSPEC:
  In the previous build, I deleted too much in the exception handler for the SimpSimp function.
  Use WFCN instead of the literal function name.
  Append \r\n to the end of all text that might be displayed via <OutputDebugString>.
  Delete unused variables.
