Version 0.4.4.xx consists of the following Builds:


Build #1167 -- Version 0.4.4.xx
-------------------------------

* Display Prompt After )RESET With No Suspension

Directory trunk:

SC_RESET.C:
  Update copyright year.
  As it turns out, when executing )RESET with no suspension, at no point
    is the six-space indent displayed, so we explicitly display the prompt.

-------------------------------

Directory trunk:

ASSIGN.C:
  Improve comments.

DISPDBG.C:
  Fix typo in <astFlagNames>.
  Improve comments.
  In <DisplayFcnSub>, handle Del and DelDel.

EXECMFN.C:
  In <ExecNilMFO>, erase the function after executing it.

FREE.C:
  In <FreeResultGlobalDfn>, don't handle permanent (i.e. MFOs) specially
    as we need to delete them and their resources from HSHTABSTRs.

GETFNS.C:
  In <GetGlbPtrs_LOCK>, handle Del and DelDel.

SC_LOAD.C:
  In <CheckGlobals>, order []vars alphabetically, and include []FEATURE.

STARTADDR.H:
SYSVARS.C:
  Rename <InitSystemVars> to <InitSysVars> to parallel <CopySysVars> and <DeleSysVars>.

TABCTRL.C:
  In <FreeGlobalStorage>, free the HshTabs & SymTabs for MFOs.
  In <FreeGlobalStorage>, at the end free []EM.


Build #1164 -- Version 0.4.4.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug For Embedded Assignment Within An AFO

Directory trunk:

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <fnAlpDone> when tokenizing a name in an AFO, first lookup this name
    through the chain of HTS.  If found, use that STE; if not, append the
    name to the global HTS.
  In <fnAsnDone>, if a name is assigned to, ensure that preceding instances
    of that name in the same stmt use the same STE.


Build #1163 -- Version 0.4.4.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Loading An AFO From A Workspace

Directory trunk:

SAVEFCN.C:
  Improve comments.
  When loading an AFO from a workspace and tokenizing the line so as to
    determine operator valence (if it's an operator), and whether or not
    it's a niladic (derived) function, include the surrounding braces in
    the line length.


Build #1162 -- Version 0.4.4.xx
-------------------------------

* Make Generalized Determinant More General

Directory trunk:

AFOFNS.C:
  Transfer bMFO flag from ParseLine local vars to SaveFunction local vars.

ASSIGN.C:
  Set MFO as objname if the name is that of an MFO.

EXECMFN.C:
  Set DFN_HEADER flag to indicate this is an MFO.
  Initialize Determinant Operator subroutines and run that program
    before initializing the Determinant Operator itself.

EXECMFN.H:
  Define enums and names for the Determinant Operator subroutines.

FH_PARSE.H:
  Define MFO flags for UDFO local vars.

GETFNS.C:
  In <GetGlbPtrs_LOCK>, handle named operators.

MF_DOT.H:
  Change algorithms from "expansion by minors" to permutation-based as per K.E. Iverson.

PL_PARSE.H:
  Define MFO flags for ParseLine local vars.

PL_PARSE.Y:
  Because we run MFON_MonDotInit without setting up an SIS, we need to handle NULL lpSISCur.
  Transfer bMFO flag from UDFO local vars to ParseLine local vars.

PO_DOT.C:
  Allow non-square matrices using the generalized magic functions.

SAVEFCN.C:
  In <SaveFunctionLine>, pass bMFO flag to <Tokenize_EM> as needed.

SAVEFCN.H:
  Define MFO flags for SaveFunction local vars.

VER.RC:
  Increment version # to 0.4.4.xx.
