Version 0.0.2.11 consists of the following Builds:


Build #649 -- Version 0.0.2.11
------------------------------

* Before Saving a Function Ensure The Old Object Is Also A Function

Directory trunk:

DEFINES.H:
  Update copyright year in initial copyright notice.

PF_LSHOE.C:
  Fix Bug:  In Partitioned Enclose, the case of 2 1 1 2 1 ... was
    missed because when the second 2 was parsed the previous value
    was still 2, so it didn't trigger a new item in the result.
  In <PrimFnDydLeftShoeGlb_EM>, factor out common code and omit
    incorrect DEBUG-only assertion.


Build #648 -- Version 0.0.2.11
------------------------------

* Before Saving a Function Ensure The Old Object Is Also A Function

Directory trunk:

APLERRORS.H:
  Update copyright year.
  Define new error message for SI DAMAGE.

EXECMFN.C:
  In <GetSpecialLabelNums>, include new parameter for Edit Ctrl
    window handle.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Improve comments.
  Convert <MessageBox> calls to Unicode.
  After displaying a Message Box, set the focus to the parent
    of the Edit Ctrl window.
  Before displaying a Message Box, split cases depending upon
    whether or not we're not called from the Master Frame.
  Before saving a function, check to see if the old object is
    also a function and thus can be overwritten by the new one.
  In <GetSpecialLabelNums> pass down the Edit Ctrl window
    handle so we can use it to set the focus on an error.

VERSION.RC:
  Increment version to 0.0.2.11.
