Build #2278 -- Version 0.6.2.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Point Notation When Mixing RATs & VFPs

Directory branches/bsmith/NanTypes:

PN_PROC.C:
  In <PN_MakeRatPoint> when changing the result from RAT to VFP, clear the bRatSep flag.
  In <PN_MakeHc2Point>, if the incoming storage type is VFP, don't process the result as a RAT.
