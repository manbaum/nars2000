Build #2247 -- Version 0.5.14.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Random Bug With 1 & 2 []DR when A Uninitialized Stack Variable Is Mistakenly Used

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

QF_DR.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  The above change actually fixes a bug where I use <lpMemRht> instead of <lpMemHdrRht>.
