* Implement Internal Functions To Calculate Squared Norms

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

HC_PROC.C:
  Implement internal functions to calculate Squared Norms.

MACROS.H:
  Define equates for non-DEBUG calls to Squared Norms.

PF_COLONBAR.C:
  In monadic and dyadic ColonBar functions, call Squared Norms when needed.

PF_NEQUAL.C:
  In monadic NotEqual functions, call Squared Norms as needed.

PF_STILE.C:
  In monadic Magnitude functions, call Squared Norms as needed.
  In dyadic Residue functions for Quaternions, fix bug where some comparisons are fizzy and some are not.  This has the effect
    of producing different results for FLT and RAT arguments that are otherwise identical, and can be fixed by making
    more comparisons fuzzy.
