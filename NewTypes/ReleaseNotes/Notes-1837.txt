* Fix Bug When Handling Inline System Labels In An AFO

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PARSELINE.C:
  After <PARSELINE_DONE:> if we're not at EOL and the leftmost token is an AFO NOP, skip back over the NOP to the EOS/EOL.
  After <PARSELINE_DONE:> if we're not at EOL, skip over the next stmt if it's a System Label.
