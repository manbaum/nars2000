Build #1730 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Ctrl-Break Pressed

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>, suspend when <RESETFLAG_xxx> is <STOP>.

IMMEXEC.C:
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, after executing the stmt, if the <exitType> is <STOP>, don't act on errors.


Build #1729 -- Version 0.5.3.xx

Build #1728 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Inner Product With Storage Types

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PO_DOT.C:
  Fix bug in Inner Product with confusion with the storage type of the right argument in the first reduction and the same argument in the second and subsequent reductions.
  Use <CopyAll> function to avoid spurious compiler warning.


Build #1727 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Include More Files Under Version Control

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

AFOFNS.H:
BISON.PROPS:
BISON.TARGETS:
NARS2000.VCXPROJ.FILTERS:
PROTOTYPE.PROPS:
PROTOTYPE.TARGETS:
QF_NFNS.H:
  Include these files which were previously omitted from a build, or were previously generated by the Visual Studio compiler but are not now.


Build #1726 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Inner Product Using Wrong Storage Type

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PO_DOT.C:
  In <PrimOpDydDotCommon_EM_YY>, when doing the reduction part (i.e., calling <PrimFnDydSiScSiScSub_EM>),
    we pass the wrong storage type for the reduction value so far.  This bug affects Inner Products whose
    Comparison storage type is lower then the Reduction storage type, such as +.=.


Build #1725 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In The Magic Function For []VR Not Using A Local HSHTABSTR

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECMFN.C:
  Make explicit tests of ptr against "NE NULL".
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  In <Init1MagicFunction>, check for incoming <INIT_MFO> struc and handle accordingly.
  In <InitMagicFunctions>, initialize a local struc <INIT_MFO> to pass additional args to <Init1MagicFunction>.

PERTAB.H:
  Allocate room for a local HSHTABSTR for the []VR magic function.

QF_VR.C:
  In <SysFnMonVR_EM_YY>, pass a ptr to the local HSHTABSTR for the magic function.

SESSMAN.C:
  In <SMWndProc/WM_DESTROY>, also delete the system vars in []VR's local HSHTABSTR.
