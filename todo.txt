DONE:  General
--------------
* Demote arrays to a more compact storage type???
* Is it a problem that TypeDemote doesn't demote from
  TKT_VARARRAY to TKT_VARIMMED?

DONE:  Session Manager
----------------------
* Mouse selection in session manager:  line, sentence, block
* CUA keystrokes:  e.g. Ctrl-RightArrow, etc.
* Tabs for workspaces
*


DONE:  Bugs
-----------
* Fix error caret position
*


DONE:  Features
---------------
* Function/operator assignment
* Monadic and dyadic rho
* Monadic left shoe (enclose w/axis)
* Monadic and dyadic plus/minus/etc. (w/axis)
* Session manager
* Compose operator
* ± infinity
* Use structured exception handling to change storage
  type on the fly (such as {floor} {infinity})
* Monadic []DR
* []TS
* []TC, []TCxxx
* []TYPE
* []SYSID
* []SYSVER
*


QUESTIONS
---------
* In assignment, can a var overwrite a fn, and vice versa
  or must the original object be erased first?
* In function assignment,

  f{is}+
  g{is}f[1]

  should <g> reference
  what happens to <g> if we change <f>
* Should we allow f {is} {jot}{dot}   ?? (right operator)
* Should we allow f {is} {jot}fn      ?? (left operator)
* When adding two empty vectors whose prototypes are
  0 (0 0) and (0 0) 0, the resulting empty vector's prototype
  should be (0 0) (0 0).
* How should an empty vector display?
  On APL+WIN systems 3.6 + 5.x, '' displays by skipping one blank line
  but 0{rho}{enclose}{zilde} displays without skipping a blank line.

File Extensions
---------------

All files will end in the extension ".nars".  There will be a secondary
extension to the left of the global extension such as .ws.nars for workspaces,
(e.g. porsche.ws.nars).

Workspaces              .ws.nars
File Systems            .file.nars
Plugins                 .plugin.nars
Initialization File     .ini



Anomalous Results
-----------------
* =/'a' and =\'a' both return 'a' which isn't in the range
  of "=" -- that seems odd.
* Similarly, =\3 0{rho}'' returns its argument with a prototype
  which isn't in the range of the derived function.
* ...


MISSING On Laptop
-----------------

* Qualitas.h (SVN)
* Fix Filezilla access to BOB
* DEPSCAN.exe (SVN)
* VDIR.exe (SVN)
* Look at Zview for APL to see what controls they use
* M: MSVC152
* N: MSVC4
* $(HCDIR)HCRTF
* Axialis
* VCCORE
* MSDN
