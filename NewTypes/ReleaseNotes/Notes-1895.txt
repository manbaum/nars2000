Build #1895 -- Version 0.5.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Extend Index Coalescing To Indexed Assignment And Modified Indexed Assignment

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

FREE.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  In <FreeTempResult>, call <FreeResult> as the subfunction instead of
    <FreeResultSub> so as to free curried items as well.

PARSELINE.C:
  Coalesce repeated indices for Indexed Assignment and Modified Indexed
    Assignment.

PF_INDEX.C:
  Fix bug in <ArrayIndexFcnSet>, so as to allow indexing into non-singleton set arguments.
