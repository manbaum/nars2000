* Fix Bug In Execute With Variant Operator And No Result

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECMFN.C:
  Rename MFO_MonDotInit to MFO_AfoMfoInit so as to define Monadic Execute with Variant function.
  Define <InitHTS> and <DeleHTS> both extracted from <Init1MagicFunction> as separately callable.
  After calling <MFO_AfoMfoInit> set the HGLOBAL for that function info <lpMemPTD->hGlbMFO[]>.
  Remove initialization call for <MFO_MonExecute> as it is now initialized in <MFO_AfoMfoInit>.

EXECMFN.H:
  Rename MFO_MonDotInit to <MFO_AfoMfoInit> so as to define Monadic Execute with Variant function.

MF_DOT.H:
  Rename MFO_MonDotInit to <MFO_AfoMfoInit> so as to define Monadic Execute with Variant function.
  Initialize <MFO_MonExecute> from within <MFO_AfoMfoInit>.

MF_VARIANT.H:
   Delete the definition of <MFO_MonExecute> as it is now defined within <MFO_AfoMfoInit>.
