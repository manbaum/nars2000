Build #1843 -- Version 0.5.5.xx
--------------------------------

* Miscellaneous DEBUG Changes

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

DEBUG.C:
  Insert commented out code in an unsuccessful attempt to wait until the DEBUG window is ready to receive messages.  That goal is still elusive.
  In <DBWndProc/MYWM_INIT_DB> ensure the DEBUG window is up-to-date with its messages.
  In <DBWndProc/WM_NCDESTROY>, invalidate the DEBUG window handle.
  In both <DbgMsg> and <DbgMsgW>, if the DEBUG window isn't up as yet, send the message to the System Output Debugger.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define EXTERN of hNULL to use in a call to <WaitOnAddress>.

MAIN.C:
  In <MFWndProc/WM_NCDESTROY>, if the DEBUG window was created, WM_CLOSE it.

MAKEFILE.INC:
NARS2000.VCXPROJ:
  For DEBUG builds, include the library <synchronization.lib> which contains <WaitOnAddress> and friends.

SESSMAN.C:
  In <SMWndProc/WM_DESTROY>, delete the code that destroys the DEBUG window if it was created as that task is done elsewhere.
