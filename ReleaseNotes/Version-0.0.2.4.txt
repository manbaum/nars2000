    instead of OBJNAME_SYS.

NAMECLASS.H:
  Update copyright year.

    Labels and Magic Functions to the 21+ range so as not to overlap
    other vendor's use.
  In <SysFnDydNL_EM_YY>, widen the nameclass bit bucket to 64 bits.
  In <SysFnDydNL_EM_YY>, check for valid range for the input.

SC_FNOV.C:
  Change <stNameType> from <UINT> to <NAME_TYPES> for a better view
    when debugging.

Build #526 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  When saving a function array that contains a user-defined
  function/operator, copy the function name to the text rather than
  the global reference as teh global reference has already been
  resolved.

Directory trunk:

SC_SAVE.C:
  In <SavedWsFormGlbVar>, widen array to handle FMTCHR_LEAD when
    using 64-bit ptrs.
  Fix Bug:  In <SavedWsFormGlbVar>, when saving a function array that
    contains a user-defined function/operator, copy the function name
    to the text rather than the global reference as the global
    reference has already been resolved.


Build #525 -- Version 0.0.2.4
-----------------------------

* Implement []AT

Directory trunk:

COMPRO.H:
  Include "qf_at.pro" in the list of prototype files.

EXECMFN.C:
  When initializing a magic function at system startup,
    save the current time in the function header so it may
    be retrieved by []AT.

MAKEFILE.INC:
MAKEFILE.SRC:
NARS2000.32.VCPROJ:
NARS2000.64.VCPROJ:
  Define entries for new files for []AT.
