Version 0.0.2.14 consists of the following Builds:


Build #668 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Clear A Certain Flag To Avoid Confusion If the Array Is Copied

Directory trunk:

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <CopyArray_EM> when copying a var, be sure to clear
    the <SkipRefCntIncr> flag as it certainly doesn't apply
    to the result.

REFCNT.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <ChangeRefCntDir_PTB> when changing the RefCnt of
    a permanent var, be sure to clear the <SkipRefCntIncr> flag
    so it doesn't get copied to a copy of the var.


Build #667 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Rank Operator Fails To Process The Prototype In The Result

Directory trunk:

PO_DIJOT.C:
  Fix Bug:  If the result from the Rank Operator is empty, we fail
    to process the prototype when calculating the minimum/maximum
    ranks before deciding whether or not to call the Conforming
    Disclose magic function.
  Fix Bug:  Both the monadic and dyadic magic functions failed to
    setup the rank vector arguments when called at []PRO.


Build #666 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  When Copying Variable In A Function Strand, Increment
  The RefCnt If Not Called At The Top Level

Directory trunk:

STRAND.C:
  Pass additional arg to <YYCopyFcn> to tell whether or not it's called
    from the top level.

YYFNS.C:
  Pass additional arg to <YYCopyFcn> to tell whether or not it's called
    from the top level.
  In <YYCopyFcn> when copying a var in a function strand, if we're
    called at the top level don't increment the RefCnt, otherwise do.


Build #665 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Pass On Operand Axis Token For Certain Operators

Directory trunk:

PO_CMIDDOT.C:
PO_DITILDE.C:
  Update copyright year.
  Rename <lptkAxis>/<lptkAxis2> to operator/operand-specific names.

PO_DIERESIS.C:
  Rename <lptkAxis>/<lptkAxis2> to operator/operand-specific names.
  Pass on the operand axis token when calling <ExecFuncOnToken_EM>.
  Check for operand axis token presence before marking as
    primitive scalar dyadic.

PO_DOT.C:
PO_SLASH.C:
  Rename <lptkAxis>/<lptkAxis2> to operator/operand-specific names.
  Check for operand axis token presence before marking as
    primitive scalar dyadic.

PO_JOTDOT.C:
  Rename <lptkAxis>/<lptkAxis2> to operator/operand-specific names.
  Pass on the operand axis token when calling <ExecFuncOnToken_EM>.


Build #664 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Rename Internal Variables To Reflect Non-ASCIIZ Nature

Directory trunk:

SYMTAB.C:
  In <SymTabLookupNameLength>, rename "lpwsz" prefixed-names
    to "lpw" as the names aren't zero-terminated.
  Improve comments.


Build #663 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Allow :SWITCH As An Alias of :SELECT

Directory trunk:

TOKENIZE.C:
  Allow :SWITCH as an alias of :SELECT.


Build #662 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Widen Syntax Color Categories To Avoid Truncation Of Names

Directory trunk:

EXTERNS.H:
  Expand the wording of Syntax Color categories.

MAIN.RC:
  Widen the Syntax Color categories so we don't truncate names.


Build #661 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Customize When Changing a Foreground Syntax Color

Directory trunk:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Fix Bug:  In <CustomizeDlgProc>, when Applying a change to a foreground
    Syntax Color, a previous optimization caused the change to be lost.


Build #660 -- Version 0.0.2.14
------------------------------

* Check for System Label Conflict

Directory trunk:

PO_SLASH.C:
  Test for simultaneous use of []ID and []PRO and signal a
    NONCE ERROR if so as we need to work on System Labels more.

VERSION.RC:
  Increment version to 0.0.2.14.
