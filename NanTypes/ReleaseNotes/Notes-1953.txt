Build #1953 -- Version 0.5.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Use Arrays For Lookup Instead Of Functions
* Use Common Constants More Instead Of Separate Variables

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

DATATYPE.H:
  Correct file location of co-dependents.
  Rename <ArrayTypeAsChar> to <aArrayTypeAsChar> to reflect that it's an array.

EXTERNS.H:
  Improve comments.
  Delete <FloatPi2> as it's no longer used.
  Define <aArrayTypeAsChar> as a variable so it may be used to lookup <ARRAY_TYPES>.
  Define <TranslateArrayTypeToChar> as an array lookup instead of as a function.
  Delete <mpXXOne> and <mpXXZero> variables as they are now defined in terms of common constants.

HC_PROC.H:
  Define <mpXXZero> and <mpXXOne> in terms of common constants.

TRANSLATE.C:
  Define <TranslateArrayTypeToChar> as an array lookup instead of as a function.
  Simplify <TranslateCharToArrayType> using <aArrayTypeAsChar>.
  In <TranslateCharToType>, include additional translations.
