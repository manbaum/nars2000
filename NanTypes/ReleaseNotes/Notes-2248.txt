Build #2248 -- Version 0.6.2.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Random Bug With 1 & 2 []DR when A Uninitialized Stack Variable Is Mistakenly Used

Directory branches/bsmith/NanTypes:

QF_DR.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  The above change actually fixes a bug where I use <lpMemRht> instead of <lpMemHdrRht>.
