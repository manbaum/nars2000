Version 0.0.2.7 consists of the following Builds:


Build #606 -- Version 0.0.2.7
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug When Parsing 1 []TF 'a b'

Directory trunk:

QF_TF.C:
  In <SysFnDydTF1_EM_YY> when parsing 1 []TF 'a b', a SWITCH stmt
    falls through to a defstop instead of branching to the empty
    case because the blank after the 'a' is interpreted as marking
    the inverse translation case and the following char is not one
    of 'FCN'.


Build #605 -- Version 0.0.2.7
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug When Translating UpCaret (0x2227) For []TF or )OUT

Directory trunk:

TRANSLATE.C:
  In <TranslateNARSToAPL2>, when translating an UpCaret to APL2
    if the char is not found, make it a circumflex (^).


Build #604 -- Version 0.0.2.7
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug When Returning A Multiple Name Result From A UDFO

Directory trunk:

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <MakeMonPrototype_EM_PTB>, use direct reference to item instead
    of through function.
  In <MakeMonPrototype_EM_PTB>, use macro around a LPSYMENTRY before
    saving in result.
  Fix Bug:  In <CopySymGlbDir_PTB>, when given a named STE, convert
    it to an value-specific unnamed STE.  That way, the named STE
    may be changed without affecting the return value.
  Change <CopyImmSymEntry_EM> to use a named equate instead of -1.
  In <CopyArray_EM>, use macro around a LPSYMENTRY before saving in
    result.

STRAND.C:
  Change <CopyImmSymEntry_EM> to use a named equate instead of -1.
  In <MakeVarStrand_EM_YY>, use macro around a LPSYMENTRY before
    saving in result.

SYMTAB.C:
  In <MakeSymEntry_EM>, allow NULL ptr to function token.
  In <CopyImmSymEntry_EM>, use named equate instead of -1.
  In <CopyImmSymEntry_EM>, allow NULL ptr to function token.

SYMTAB.H:
  Define named equate to use instead of -1.
