Build #1684 -- Version 0.5.1.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bugs In Grade Of Single NaN And GradeAll NaNs

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

GRADE.H:
  Pass the <bGradeAll> flag down to the comparison routines.

PF_DELTASTILE.C:
  Pass the <bGradeAll> flag down to the comparison routines.
  Handle grading scalars as one-element vectors so as to catch NaNs with a check
    at the very end for scalars so as to return {enclose}{zilde}.
  In <PrimFnGradeCompare> on FLTs, test both items for NaN as some sorts don't pass
    all items through the first position.
  In <PrimFnGradeCompare> on FLTs, skip the test for NaNs if <bGradeAll>.

SORT.C:
  In <HeapSort>, if the count is <= 1, call (*ObjCmp) anyway so as to catch
    <!bGradeAll> and NaN.
