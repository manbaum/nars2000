PO_VARIANT.C:
  Allow macros to retrieve ptrs to left and right operands as NULLs,
    and ensure it doesn't happen.
  Fix bug in retrieving the left operand from a complex dyadic operator.

PARSELINE.C:
  In <ConvertNamedFopToUnnamed>, remove Assert stmt for FCNARRAY_HEADERs
    as the SynObj can sometimes be SPM.

PL_PARSE.H:
  Define additional field to hold the offset to the previous operator which
    we need in otder to handle complex named operator operands.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Define <IsTknAxis> needed in <YYCopyFcnStr>.
  Handle Direct Functions in <GetTknOpType>.
  Define <IsTknFopDir> to detect direct functions/operators.

PRIMSPEC.C:
  In <PrimFnDydSimpSimp_EM>, fix bug trying to free non-existent vars.

STARTADDR.H:
  Include more entries.

STRAND.C:
  Pass additional parameter to <YYCopyFcnStr> so as to keep track of the
    location of the root operator.

YYFNS.C:
  Pass additional parameter to <YYCopyFcnStr> so as to keep track of the
    location of the root operator.
  Keep track of the location of the root operator and pass it back to the
    caller except for the right operand.
