Build #1626 -- Version 0.5.0.xx
--------------------------------

* Implement Unit Normalized Radian Point Notation (e.g. 1au0.25 = 1ad90)

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

CR_PROC.C:
  Fix bug in <crEndSeg> when scanning a line such as 1au0.5x where the code mistakenly finds a decimal point
    and thinks it is in the integer part of the string.

MPFNS.C:
  Implement <mpq_mul_si> as a helper function.

PN_PARSE.Y:
  Implement Unit Normalized Radian point notation.
  Define DEBUG stmts for no code terminals so they show up in a DEBUG run.

PN_PROC.C:
  Fix bug in <PN_MakeBasePoint> where a base of a Boolean 0 or 1 fails to note that the result is integer.
  In <PN_MakeHc2Point>, implement Unit Normalized Radian point notation.
