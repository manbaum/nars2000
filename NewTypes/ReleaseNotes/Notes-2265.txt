  In <PrimOpMonCombinatorial_EM_YY>, simplify setting of valid state of # Balls & Boxes.

QF_AT.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Comment out DEBUG statements which need to be re-evaluated to improve them.  At the moment, they are just unhelpful noise.
