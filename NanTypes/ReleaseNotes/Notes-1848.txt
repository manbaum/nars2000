EXECMFN.C:
  Delete parameter passed to <AllocSymTab> as it is no longer needed.
  Use a local HSHTABSTR for the Dyadic Squad Magic Function/Operator.
  Move the local HSHTABSTRs for MFOs from <pertab.h> to a global in <externs.h>.

EXTERNS.H:
PERTAB.H:
  Move the local HSHTABSTRs for MFOs from <pertab.h> to a global in <externs.h>.

MAIN.C:
  Set parent window of Crash Control Window to NULL so as to avoid locking out the keyboard.
  At the end of <MFWndProc/WM_CLOSE>, attempt to delete all of the tabs.
  At the end of <MFWndProc/WM_DESTROY>, delete the sys vars for the MFO local structs.

PF_SQUAD.C:

QF_VR.C:
  Use the global HTS for the Monadic []VR MFO.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Delete parameter passed to <AllocSymTab> as it is no longer needed.
  In <SaveFunctionCom> when the caller is <FEWndProc>, save the new <hGlbDfnHdr> as a window long ptr
    so as to provide a previous HGLOBAL when AFOs are edited.

SESSMAN.C:
  Delete parameter passed to <AllocSymTab> as it is no longer needed.
  Delete call to <DeleSysVars> for local HTS structs as they are handled at the end of <main.c>.

SYMTAB.C:
  Delete parameter passed to <AllocSymTab> as it is no longer needed.

TABCTRL.C:
  In <LclTabCtrlWndProc>, handle <TCM_DELETEALLITEMS> message.
  Use <PostQuitMessage> instead of <PostThreadMessageW> as the former doesn't need a valid thread id.
