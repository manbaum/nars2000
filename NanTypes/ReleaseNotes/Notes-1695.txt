* Fix Bug When Using A Global Dead Key To Create An Accented Character Where The Base Character Doesn't have An Accented Form

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EDITFCN.C:
  In <DeadKeyTrans>, when the base character for a global dead key doesn't have an accented form, the result is to display two characters:  the accent and the base character.  If the Dead Key is a Global one, the wrong accent symbol is displayed.
