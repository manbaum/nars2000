Build #2024 -- Version 0.6.0.xx
-------------------------------

* When calling <mpq_QuadICValue> or <mpfr_QuadICValue>, pass the sign in case the result is FLT.
* Fix Bug In Use Of <[mpfr|mpq]_QuadICValue> Where We May Double Initialize A Variable
* Define <arb_sub2> To Handle Special Case Of arb_sub (z, x, x) So That It Always Returns Zero
* Define <arb_log2> To Always Return {neg}{inf} When The Arg Is Zero.

Directory branches/bsmith/NanTypes:

PF_BAR.C:
  Fix bug in use of <[mpfr|mpq]_QuadICValue> where we may double initialize a variable.  The solution is never to return a value from these functions and always initialize the result inside the function.
  Define <arb_sub2> to handle special case of arb_sub (z, x, x) so that it always returns zero.

PF_CSTAR.C:
  Fix bug in use of <[mpfr|mpq]_QuadICValue> where we may double initialize a variable.  The solution is never to return a value from these functions and always initialize the result inside the function.
  Define <arb_log2> to always return {neg}{inf} when the arg is zero.

PF_DCARET.C:
PF_UCARET.C:
  Fix bug in the result of {floor}/{ceiling} on a Ball wider than one unit.
  Fix bug in use of <[mpfr|mpq]_QuadICValue> where we may double initialize a variable.  The solution is never to return a value from these functions and always initialize the result inside the function.

PF_PLUS.C:
PF_QDOT.C:
PF_TIMES.C:
  Fix bug in use of <[mpfr|mpq]_QuadICValue> where we may double initialize a variable.  The solution is never to return a value from these functions and always initialize the result inside the function.

PF_ROOT.C:
  Replace <arf_nan> with <arb_set_nan> so as to set both Midpoint and Radius.
  Fix bug in use of <[mpfr|mpq]_QuadICValue> where we may double initialize a variable.  The solution is never to return a value from these functions and always initialize the result inside the function.
