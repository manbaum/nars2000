* Fix Bug With Naked Goto

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY> if an error occurs and we're exiting because of a naked GOTO (EXITTYPE_RESET_ONE),
    return a NoValue entry marked as a naked GOTO.

PARSELINE.C:
  In <plExecuteFn0>, don't modify <tkSynObj> in <lpYYRes> if it's a NoValue entry.

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <scPointDone>, syntax color "au" Unit Normalized notation as Point Notation.
