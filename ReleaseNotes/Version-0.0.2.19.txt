Build #770 -- Version 0.0.2.19
------------------------------

* Subclass Certain Rebar Windows So We Can Use Multiline Tooltips

Directory trunk:

DATATYPE.H:
  Move typedefs to common file <types.h>.

DEFINES.H:
  Move definition of <MYWM_INIT_EC> from <editctrl.h> to here so it

  Replace <datatype.h> with <types.h>.
  Remove <main.h> as we're deleting that file.

EDITCTRL.H:
  Move definition of <MYWM_INIT_EC> from here to <defines.h> so it
    can be used by other window procedures.

EDITFCN.C:
  Change the width of character position vars from <DOWRD> to <APLU3264>
    so it is sensitive to 32- vs. 64-bit.
  In <LclEditCtrlWndProc/WM_CHAR>, make the <wParam> and <lParam> vars
    actual vs. #defines in DEBUG vs. non-DEBUG contexts to make it easier
    to debug.
  Rename Object Window vars from <FN> to <OW>.

ENUMS.H:
  Rename Object Window vars from <FN> to <OW>.
  Move enums to common file <enums.h>.

EXTERNS.H:
  Rename Object Window vars from <FN> to <OW>.

    the former file.
  Move typedefs to common file <types.h>.

HEADERS.H:
  Move preprocessor instructions from <main.h> to <headers.h>
    as we're deleting the former file.
  Move <defines.h> up in the order as we need it for earlier includes.
  Include <types.h> in the list.
  Remove <main.h> as we're deleting that file.

INIPARSER.C:

  Transfer the contents of thie file to <enums.h>, <types.h>,
    and <headers.h>, and remove the file

MAIN.RC:
  Rename Object Window vars from <FN> to <OW>.
  Rename resource vars for functions from <_FN> to <FCN> to
    avoid conflict with Font Name vars.

MAKEFILE.INC
  Remove <main.h> as we're deleting that file.

REBAR.C:
  Rename Object Window vars from <FN> to <OW>.
  Use multiple image lists so the tooltip for the dropdown arrows
    is separate from the tooltip for the icon associated with the
    dropdown arrow.
  Subclass the Workspace, Edit, and Objects windows so we can
    tell the Tooltip Control that we're using multiline tooltips.
  Rename resource vars for functions from <_FN> to <FCN> to
    avoid conflict with Font Name vars.
  Define routine to handle subclassing of the Workspace, Edit, and
    Objects windows.  In particular, we need to handle the mouse
    move and leave messages and tell the Tooltip Control that we're
    using multiline tooltips.
  Improve comments.
