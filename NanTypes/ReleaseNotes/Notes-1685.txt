Build #1685 -- Version 0.5.1.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bugs In Divide Of HC Numbers

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PF_COLONBAR.C:
  Reduce the column width of many lines by folding them to the nest.
  In Monadic and Dyadic Divide functions, calculate the denominator by multiplying the right arg by its conjugate.
    Previously we summed the squares, but this doesn't catch some errors with infinities.

PF_TIMES.C:
  In <MulHCxy_RE> special case "a EQ 0" and "c EQ 0" so as to avoid an error if "b" or "d" is {inf}.
