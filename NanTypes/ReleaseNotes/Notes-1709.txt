* Defer Initializing MPFR Constants When Changing Precision Via []FPC

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

INITDATA.C:
  Defer initializing MPFR Pi, e, and Gamma into their own individual functions.
    This way, if the user changes []FPC to a high value (which takes some time to
    initialize those constants), only when those constants are referenced will they
    be initialized (and take some time to do so).

PF_CIRCLE.C:
PF_STAR.C:
PN_PROC.C:
  Ensure the MPFR constants Pi, and Gamma are initialized before referencing them.
