* Fix Bug In Floor Between FLT and RAT

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PF_DSTILE.:
  Fix bug in Floor where it returns different values for the same value as a FLT vs. as a RAT.  The problem is
    that they used different comparisons, both meant to be exact, but on values that differed by a few ULPs
    because of the different ways FLT and RAT calculates distances.  Now all of those comparisons use []CT.
  Improve comments.
