  Rename <nMinState> to <nWinState> to better reflect its meaning.
  In <MFWndProc> define and save the initial alue of <MFState> from
    the .ini fileto test later on as the latter value can change
    before we need the original value.
  If the original value of <MFState> says to maximize the initial
    window, do so after the <WM_CREATE> message.
