Build #2078 -- Version 0.6.0.xx
-------------------------------

* Implement Workspace Features To Allow Multiple Features And Non-Downward Compatible Features To Co-exist

Directory branches/bsmith/NanTypes:

ASSIGN.C:
EXECDFN.C:
  Rename<TranslateDfnToNameType> to <TranslateDfnTypeToNameType> to be more consistent with other function names in <translate.c>.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define section on Workspace Feature Values.

HEADERS.H:
  Copy <#include "workspace.h"> from <pertab.h> to #define certain names used in <externs.h>.

MAIN.RC:
  Lengthen the "About" dialog box to accommodate the list of workspace features supported by this version.

PERTAB.H:
  Surround <#include "workspace.h"> with #define/#undef so it #defines the structures, too.

PRIMFNS.C:
  Define function <IsTknFcnOprVar> like <IsTknFcnOpr> but including Vars.
  In <RoundUpBitsInArray>, round up Bits to a byte boundary instead of DWORD.
  Take the last change into account in <CalcArraySize>.
  In <IsTknnamed>, change the status of DEL and DELDEL to FALSE.
  Define function <IsTknDel> like <IsSymDel>, but for tokens.

SC_BOX.C:
  Fix minor display bug in )BOX which mistakenly inserts an extra line after the command.

SC_COPY.C:
  Before )COPYing, check to see that the source ws doesn't have unsupported features.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Before )LOADing, check to see that the source ws doesn't have unsupported features.

SC_SAVE.C:
  While )SAVEing a workspace, check for features that old interpreters might choke on and put a notice into the saved workspace.

TRANSLATE.C:
  Rename<TranslateDfnToNameType> to <TranslateDfnTypeToNameType> to be more consistent with other function names in <translate.c>.
  In <TranslateNameTypeToImmType>, allow niladic function name type.
  In <TranslateFcnOprToStr>, ensure the result is properly terminated

VER.C:
  In the "About" dialog box, display the Workspace Features this version supports.

WORKSPACE.H:
  #define keynames and feature names for Workspace Features.
