* Fix Incorrect SYNTAX ERRORs

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PARSELINE.C:
PARSELINE.H:
  Fix SYNTAX bug with "LO {DOP} RO A" where the Binding Strength (BS) between
    "}" and "F" was lower than the BS between "F" and "A", and so "F A" was evaluated first.
  Fix SYNTAX bug with "(LO {DOP} RO) A" where the Reduction of "DOP" and "FR" to "MR" was missing.
  Fix memory leak in <plRedNF_A> where after an error from evaluating "NF", "A" was not freed.
