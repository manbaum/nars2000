Build #1853 -- Version 0.5.5.xx
--------------------------------

* Miscellanous DEBUG Changes

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

CRASH.C:
  When displaying the Crash Window MessageBox, use the same window handle as the parent so we might avoid keyboard lock within the MessageBox.

EXECFNS.C:
  Whenever we are about to signal a LIMIT ERROR due to an unrecognized error in a more deeply nested function, within <#ifdef DEBUG/#endif> statements, trigger a Debug Break and display info about the exception.
