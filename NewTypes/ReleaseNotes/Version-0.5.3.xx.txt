DISPLAY.C:
  Insert blank line for clarity.

EDITFCN.C:
  In <LclECPaintHook>, re-organize the logic behind when we Syntax Color or not.

MAIN.RC:
  Increase the height of the Group Boxes surrounding the Foreground & Background columns in Syntax Coloring.

PF_PI.C:
  Fix typo in comment.


Build #1731 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Hash Or Symbol Tables Are Low

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXCEPT.C:
  Compare against correct equate instead of just 0.

EXECMFN.C:
  When allocating Hash & Symbol Tables, indicate whether or not the owner is an AFO or MFO.
  Use equates for Hash & Symbol Table allocation sizes instead of constants.
  Use variable name for Hash & Symbol Table maximum NELM instead of constant so it can be overridden on the command line.

EXTERNS.H:
  Define external vars for command line values.

MAIN.C:
  Use different equate for <iHshTabIncrFree> value.
  In <TestCmdLine>, allow a colon as well as an equal sign to separate the keyword and it's matching value.
  In <ParseCommandLine>, test for additional keywords.

SAVEFCN.C:
  When allocating Hash & Symbol Tables, indicate whether or not the owner is an AFO or MFO.
  Use variable name for Hash & Symbol Table maximum NELM instead of constant so it can be overridden on the command line.

SC_SYMB.C:
  Change type from <int> to <size_t> and rename from <i...> to <u...> to reflect the unsigned nature.
  Display Hash & Symbol Table info for AFOs and MFOs.

SESSMAN.C:
  When allocating Hash & Symbol Tables, indicate whether or not the owner is an AFO or MFO.

SYMTAB.C:
  Make explicit tests of ptr against "NE NULL".
  In <HshTabSplitNextEntry_EM>, read from last byte we might split into so as to trigger the Page Fault early before we have moved any Hash Table Entries because we can't move them back if we fail.
  In <FindNextFreeUsingHash_SPLIT_EM> and <FindNextFreeUsingHTE_EM>, trap errors in called functions so as to pass the error on to our caller,
    and use 64-bit arithmetic on the offsets in case the 32-bit offset might overflow.

SYMTAB.H:
  Define equates for AFO and MFO Hash & Symbol Tables.
  Define additional fields in <HSHTABSTR>.

VER.C:
  Use proper equates for Hash & Symbol Table multipliers.


Build #1730 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Ctrl-Break Pressed

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecuteFunction_EM_YY>, suspend when <RESETFLAG_xxx> is <STOP>.

IMMEXEC.C:
  In <ImmExecStmtInThread>, after executing the stmt, if the <exitType> is <STOP>, don't act on errors.


Build #1729 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Reduction Of An Empty Character Array

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PO_SLASH.C:
  If reducing an empty character vector, signal a DOMAIN ERROR unless the reduction operand is the Equal or NotEqual function.


Build #1728 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Inner Product With Storage Types

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PO_DOT.C:
  Fix bug in Inner Product with confusion with the storage type of the right argument in the first reduction and the same argument in the second and subsequent reductions.
  Use <CopyAll> function to avoid spurious compiler warning.


Build #1727 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Include More Files Under Version Control

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

AFOFNS.H:
BISON.PROPS:
BISON.TARGETS:
NARS2000.VCXPROJ.FILTERS:
PROTOTYPE.PROPS:
PROTOTYPE.TARGETS:
QF_NFNS.H:
  Include these files which were previously omitted from a build, or were previously generated by the Visual Studio compiler but are not now.


Build #1726 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Inner Product Using Wrong Storage Type

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PO_DOT.C:
  In <PrimOpDydDotCommon_EM_YY>, when doing the reduction part (i.e., calling <PrimFnDydSiScSiScSub_EM>),
    we pass the wrong storage type for the reduction value so far.  This bug affects Inner Products whose
    Comparison storage type is lower then the Reduction storage type, such as +.=.


Build #1725 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In The Magic Function For []VR Not Using A Local HSHTABSTR

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECMFN.C:
  Make explicit tests of ptr against "NE NULL".
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  In <Init1MagicFunction>, check for incoming <INIT_MFO> struc and handle accordingly.
  In <InitMagicFunctions>, initialize a local struc <INIT_MFO> to pass additional args to <Init1MagicFunction>.

PERTAB.H:
  Allocate room for a local HSHTABSTR for the []VR magic function.

QF_VR.C:
  In <SysFnMonVR_EM_YY>, pass a ptr to the local HSHTABSTR for the magic function.

SESSMAN.C:
  In <SMWndProc/WM_DESTROY>, also delete the system vars in []VR's local HSHTABSTR.

  Include file overlooked from the last build.


Build #1722 -- Version 0.5.3.xx
--------------------------------

EXTERNS.H:
  Define new cursor handles.

MAIN.C:
  Load new cursor handles.

MAIN.RC:
  Define new cursor resource.

MAKEFILE.INC:
  Define new cursor dependency.
