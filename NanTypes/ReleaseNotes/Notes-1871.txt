* Fix Bug In Rank Operator Should Be Sensitive To Axis Operator

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

MF_DIJOT.H:
  Make the monadic and dyadic Magic Operator for the Rank operator sensitive to the axis operator.

PO_DIJOT.C:
  Make the Rank operator sensitive to the axis operator by passing that value from the top to the bottom of the chain, and eventually to the Magic Operator.
