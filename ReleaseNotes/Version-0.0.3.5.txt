Version 0.0.3.5 consists of the following Builds:


Build #957 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug In N-wise Reduce

Directory trunk:

PF_CSTILE.C:
PF_SLASH.C:
PF_SLOPE.C:
PO_SLOPE.C:
  Test for correct function (CircleStile vs. CircleBar or Slash vs. SlashBar
    or Slope vs. SlopeBar) when calculating the axis value.

PO_SLASH.C:
  Test for correct function (Slash vs. SlashBar) when calculating the axis value.
  Delete special case of N-wise reduce where the left arg is the negative of the
    axis length.  Not only do we not need this special case, but it's wrong as
    the function passed to <PrimFnMonCircleStile_EM_YY> isn't one of CircleStile
    or CircleBar, so the result is calculated on the wrong dimension.


Build #956 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Reorder []DR Constants

Directory trunk:

QF_DR.C:
  Move []DR constants to their own header file.
  Reorder []DR constants so that all numeric types are adjacent.
  Remove bit size from 32- vs. 64-bit HETERO/NESTED/RATIONAL/VFP constants
    as it unnecessarily complicates the function.
  Allow for COMPLEX/QUATERNION/OCTONION numbers whose coefficients may all be
    any of INTEGER, FLOAT, RATIONAL, or VFP.

QF_DR.H:
   New file containing []DR constants.


Build #955 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Use Overbar Instead Of Hyphen In Language Bar

Directory trunk:

REBAR.C:
  Use overbar instead of hyphen in language bar.


Build #954 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Remove Two LIMIT ERRORs During Tokenize

Directory trunk:

DEFINES.H:
  Undefine <DEF_NUM_MAXNELM> and <DEF_STR_MAXNELM> as they are no longer used.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Remove out-of-range checks for numerics and strings as the global memory
    handle is automatically increased in size.


Build #953 -- Version 0.0.3.5
-----------------------------

* Include Bitsize In Master Frame Window Title

Directory trunk:

DEFINES.H:
MAIN.C:
  Include bitsize in master frame window title.
