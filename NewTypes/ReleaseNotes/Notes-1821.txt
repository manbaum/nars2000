* Fix Bug In UDFO When The Function Name Is Localized

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

QF_EX.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  In <IsizSusPendent>, if the name is localized, mark as not suspended/pendent.
  Define function <IsLocalized> to detect if a name is localized at a given level.
