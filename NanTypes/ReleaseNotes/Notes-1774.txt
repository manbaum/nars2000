Build #1774 -- Version 0.5.5.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Selecting Both "Keyboards" And "User Preferences" In Customize Dialog

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

CUSTOMIZE.C:
  Use separate save areas for the subclassed WNDPROC for "Keyboards" and "User Preferences" edit ctrls.
  After calls to DestroyWindow () always return a result as that function doesn't, by itself, end the window.
  When subclassing the edit ctrl for "User Preferences", use a different WNDPROC from when subclassing the edit ctrl for "Keyboards".
  After calls to EndDialog, always return a result as that function doesn't, by itself, end the dialog.
