Version 0.3.6.xx consists of the following Builds:


Build #965 -- Version 0.3.6.xx
------------------------------

* Fix Bug In Syntax Coloring Of Local System Names

Directory trunk:

TOKENIZE.C:
  In <IsLocalName>, two constant vars are marked as static.
  In <IsLocalName>, the incoming system name is converted to lower case,
    but not the target name.  Instead, we just use a case-insensitive
    compare for system names and a case-sensitive compare for all others.


Build #964 -- Version 0.3.6.xx
------------------------------

* Fix Bug In :FORLCL

Directory trunk:

EDITFCN.C:
  When DEBUG_WM_CHAR is defined, two vars are mistakenly uninitialized.

EXECDFN.C:
  In <UnlocalizeSTEs>, fix bug in :FORLCL where the FORLCL STE is
    mistakenly handled after stripping the function STEs instead of before.


Build #963 -- Version 0.3.6.xx
------------------------------

* Fix Bug In []NREPLACE File Offset

    of the current file pointer.


Build #962 -- Version 0.3.6.xx
------------------------------

    number of times we ran the compiler.
