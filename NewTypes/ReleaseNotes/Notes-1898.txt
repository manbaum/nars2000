Build #1898 -- Version 0.5.8.xx
-------------------------------

* Fix Bug When Calling Two Niladic Functions One Of Which Erases The Other

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EXECDFN.C:
  In <ExecDfnOprGlb_EM_YY>, rename <lpYYFcnStr> to <lpYYFcnStrOpr> to avoid confusion with names with a similar prefix.

EXECFNS.C:
  Rename <ExecuteFn0> to <ExecuteFn0Glb> and add another arg so to as allow execution of HGLOBALs.

PARSELINE.C:
  In <plRedNF_NF>, handle the case where the first function executed erases the second function.
  In <plRedNF_NF>, execute the functions from right to left.
  Define <plExecuteFn0Glb> which allows execution of a function via its HGLOBAL.
