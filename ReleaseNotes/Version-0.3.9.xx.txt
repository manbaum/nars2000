Version 0.3.9.xx consists of the following Builds:


Build #1063 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Even More Miscellaneous Build File Changes

Directory trunk:

DEPTXT.BAT:
  Omit double quote marks around the argument passed to <:subroutine> as they get in the way.


Build #1062 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* More Miscellaneous Build File Changes

Directory trunk:

DEPINIT.BAT:
  Use internal mechanism to show progress instead of using an external file.

DEPTXT.BAT:
  Use batch file processing for all .dep files instead of multiple calls to
    this batch file by <nmake> as the latter appears to run the batch file in
    multiple threads which causes a race condition where each batch file is
    appending to the output file at the same time.  This wasn't a problem until
    I switched to an SSD drive!

ECHODOT.BAT:
ECHODOT.PHP:
ECHODOT.TXT:
  Delete these files as they are no longer needed.

MAKEFILE.DEP:
  Update copyright year.
  Call <deptxt.bat> once with all filenames in the argument instead of multiple
    times on one filename.

MAKEFILE.IND:
  Update copyright year.
  Parameterize <nmake> as set by the caller so we call the same program at all levels.

MK32.BAT:
MKD32.BAT:
MK64.BAT:
MKD32.BAT:
MKD64.BAT:
MKN.BAT:
  Omit DOS-era reference to <NMAKER>.
  Use FOR loop instead of multiple lines to set a variable.


Build #1061 -- Version 0.3.9.xx
-------------------------------

* Miscellaneous Build File Changes

Directory trunk:

DEPINIT.BAT:
  Avoid calling php as that only slows down the process.

DEPTXT.BAT:
  Avoid calling php as that only slows down the process, and on a fast system
    may trigger an error message saying that "The process cannot access the
    file because it is being used by another process.".

ECHODOT.TXT:
  A one-byte file containing a dot ".".  No trailing CR/LF is present so that
    typing the file from multiple calls spits out a series of dots all on one
    line until it wraps at the right edge of the CMD window.

VER.RC:
  Increment version # to 0.3.9.xx.
