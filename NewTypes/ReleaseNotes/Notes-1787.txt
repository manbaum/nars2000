Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

DEBUG.C:
  Delete call to <AttachThreadInput> which links the message queues of the Debug and Main windows as they no longer are shared.
  Format the code better.

DEFINES.H:
  Define common macro for displaying a File, Line #, and Function name.
  Include common file of equates for WineHQ and the main code.

EDITFCN.C:
  Convert calls to static messages to Unicode.
  Use local function <MySetFocus> instead of <SetFocus> API so we can check the return code more easily.
  Omit <SetCaret> from <MdiActivate> as it should be done by the routine that handles <WM_SETFOCUS>.
  Include Text Caret DEBUG code in <FEWndProc> and <LclEditCtrlWndProc>.

MACROS.H:
  Define macro for <ExecAssert> which executes the expression and validates the result.
  Define various Boolean macros to aid in dealing with them.

MAIN.C:
  Declare <cdbThread> an extern so we can reference it.
  Use <PostThreadMessageW< instead of <SendMessageW> when setting the font for the DEBUG window.
  Delete call to <DestroyCaret> from <MFWndProc/WM_NOTIFY/TCN_SELCHANGING> as it should be called from <WM_KILLFOCUS/WM_SETFOCUS> only.
  Handle message <WM_SETFOCUS> in <MFWndProc>.

SAVEFCN.C:
  Use local function <MySetFocus> instead of <SetFocus> API so we can check the return code more easily.

SESSMAN.C:
  Include Text Caret DEBUG code in <FEWndProc> and <LclEditCtrlWndProc>.
  Use local function <MySetFocus> instead of <SetFocus> API so we can check the return code more easily.

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes/WineHQ:

EDITCTRL.C:
  Include Text Caret DEBUG code in <FEWndProc> and <LclEditCtrlWndProc>.
  Use local function <MySetFocus> instead of <SetFocus> API so we can check the return code more easily.
