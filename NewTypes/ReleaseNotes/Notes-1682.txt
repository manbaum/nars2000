Build #1682 -- Version 0.5.1.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bugs In []EA And []EC

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

PRIMFNS.C:
  In <GetSISLayer>, skip past DFNTYPE_ERRCTL along with the other already present.
    This allows a branch within []EA to change the next function line number when that function becomes active again.

QF_EA.C:
  In IF stmts always compare ptr against NULL.
  Include "Hdr" in name of result of <MyGlobalLock>.
  In <SysFnDydEA_EM_YY>, when calling <PrimFnMonUpTackJotCommon_EM_YY>, tell that function to return a NoValue YYRes if appropriate
    This allows a branch to a number to return the proper result to the caller.

QF_EC.C:
  In <SysFnMonEC_EM_YY>, save the caller's function line and token number before executing the right arg and restore it upon return.
    This avoids a branch to a number from changing the caller's next function line number when that function becomes active again.
