Build #1680 -- Version 0.5.1.xx
--------------------------------

* Fix Bug In <IsLocalName>

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

EDITFCN.C:
  Skip passing to <IsLocalName> a ptr to a temp work area.

TOKENIZE.C:
  Skip passing to <IsLocalName> a ptr to a temp work area.
  In <IsLocalName> allocate space as needed for a temp work area as the global one passed in sometimes is used by another thread.
