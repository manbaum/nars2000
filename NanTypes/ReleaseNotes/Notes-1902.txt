* Fix Bug When Branching Inside A []ELX Statement

Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

GOTO.C:
  In IF/WHILE stmts always compare ptr against NULL and value against 0.
  In <GotoLine_EM> when winding back the SI stack looking for a UDFO, skip over DFNTYPE_FCNs with a NULL hGlbDfnHdr.
  In <GotoLine_EM>, if a valid UDFO is found, mark is as no longer suspended.
