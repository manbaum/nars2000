Directory branches/bsmith/NewTypes:

NARS2000.VCXPROJ:
  Note GSL dependency of <main.c>.  This file was omitted from the previous build.

PARSELINE.C:
  In <plRedF_IDX>, handle multiple indices as in F[A][A][A] A by collapsing the IDX chain.

PARSELINE.H:
  In order to allow the above code to work, we need to increase the binding of IDX v. IDX.
