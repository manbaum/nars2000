Version 0.0.3.2 consists of the following Builds:


Build #881 -- Version 0.0.3.2
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Set Precision Of VFP Constants Based On # Digits

Directory trunk:

PN_PARSE.Y:
  In <PN_MakeVfpPoint>, calculate the # significant bits in the number and
    set the precision to the larger of that and the current precision so as
    not to under-represent the precision of a constant.


Build #880 -- Version 0.0.3.2
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Blow Up !R and L!R To VFP If Non-integral

Directory trunk:

PF_QDOT.C:
  In <PrimFnMonQuoteDotRisR>, blow up to VFP if non-integral or numerator too large.

SC_LOAD.C:
  Fix typo.


Build #879 -- Version 0.0.3.2
-----------------------------

* Fix Bug:  Signal NONCE ERROR If We Can't Factor A Number
* Fix Bug:  Nth Prime and # Primes Not Working

Directory trunk:

PF_PI.C:
  Return TRUE/FALSE from <PrimFnPiCommon>.
  Return TRUE/FALSE from <PrimeFactor>.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimeFactor>, test indeterminate result for pseudo-primality
    and signal a NONCE ERROR if not likely a prime.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnPiNthPrime> andf <PrimFnPiNumPrimes>, suffix <mpz_cmp>s
    with "EQ 0" to test for equal.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnPiNthPrime>, initialize the temp before using.
  Fix Bug:  In <PrimFnPiNumPrimes>, don't re-initialize already initialized temps.

VER.C:
  In <LclFileVersionStrW>, include debugging stmts to figure out why it fails in Wine.

VERSION.RC:
  Increment version to 0.0.3.2.
