Build #2200 -- Version 0.6.0.xx
-------------------------------

* Miscellaneous ARB Changes

Directory branches/bsmith/NanTypes:

INITDATA.C:
  Define entries for DoubleTilde function prototypes.

PF_RCARETUND.C:
  In <RightCaretUnd_Inner>/ARRAY_FLOAT, ensure the right arg is finite before saving the result's radius.

PF_STAR.C:
  In <ExpArb_RE>, check against a number smaller than COEFF_MAX as ARB fails on that number in a 64-bit ABI.

PO_DBLTILDE.C:
  Define entry points for dyadic LeftCaret, LeftCaretUnderbar, Equal, RighCaretUnderbar, RightCaret, NotEqual, LsRs, on Balls.

PO_DBLTILDE.MAC:
  Use new function <arf_set_nan> to set a NaN.

TOKENS.H:
  Include file omitted from previous build for <tkMatch>.

TYPES.H:
  Define <acb_struct> for Complex Balls.
